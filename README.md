## Running Average Custom Device ##

The **Running Average Custom Device** allows you to take the running average of any channel with a user specified buffer. You also have the ability to reset the average (clear the buffer). The averaged value only uses values currently within the buffer, and any unitialized values in the buffer are stored as NaNs and are not taken into account as part of the average.
